Version r2d2



## Prerequisites

Use `pip` to install dependencies. We will probably push a req file later to automate the dependency installation process.

* Python 2.7+
  * Python 3.3+ support should be built in, but we currently do not utilise it on live systems and hence do not give any guarantees.
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 1.7
* [Django REST Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) 2.4
* [Django OAuth Toolkit](https://github.com/evonove/django-oauth-toolkit) 0.7
* [Mandrill for Python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mandrill/) 1.0
* [Future](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/future/)
* [Six](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six/)

A MySQL database connector is also required for MySQL installations. 

## Configuration

* Copy `myrg_core/settings.py.sample` to `myrg_core/settings.py`.
* Modify the key (generate a new one) and database settings as necessary.

## API Documentation
